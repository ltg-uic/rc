<b>waves & seismograms</b>
<br><br>
The window on the left shows the "educator" portal; this is the page that the teacher sees on her laptop. The two windows on the right are "station" portals; these are the pages that appear on the computers that will serve as
simulated seismographs.
<br><br>
Click on the "station" button on each of the station portals to select the seismograph
represented in that window. (Choose two different numbers.) Select the "instant" tab on the educator portal; this is the resource that allows the teacher to generate individual roomquakes using a map of the classroom. Click
on the map to choose an epicenter, then click "Generate quake." The page will blink after a few seconds to indicate
the initiation of the roomquake, and the seismographs will respond to the event based on their distance from the
epicenter.
<br><br>
This configuration of resources can be used to introduce learners to two-phase nature of seismograms and its reflection of the p- and s-waves generated by earthquakes. Using tape measures and stopwatches, students can estimate wavefront velocities, the distance of events from individual seismographs, and the times that the earthquakes occurred.
